Data project : predicting Olympics Medals with Machine Learning

This project's objective is to be able to predict the chances of a new athlete to winning a medal at the Olympics

We are going to use the following database : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results, and separate it between a learning part and a testing part.

We are going to use the logistic regression algorithm to reach that goal, our challenge will be implementing it correctly in our project.
