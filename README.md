Data project : predicting Olympics Medals with Machine Learning

Code : Python_Project_Data .ipynb
Database : athlete_events.csv 
DONT FORGET TO CHANGE THE LOCATION OF THE DATABASE IN THE CODE !

This project's objective is to be able to predict the chances of a new athlete to winning a medal at the Olympics

We are going to use the following database : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results, and separate it between a learning part and a testing part.

We are going to use the logistic regression algorithm to reach that goal, our challenge will be implementing it correctly in our project.

After a lot of work, we finally completed our project : in the Projet Python Data file, you will be able to see our results ! 
Our code analyses our database through logistic regression and allows us to add a new athlete and predict his chances of winning a medal (between 0 and 1)
